    "# A Chatbot using GPT and a Database\n",
    "This allows multiple chatbot types (e.g. a health coach and a learning assistant) to be created. Multiple chatbot instances can be created per chatbot type (e.g. a health coach for user X and user Y, and a learning assistant for user P and user Q). Both, types and instances are stored with and referenced by an ID (e.g. a UUID) in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a simplest possible tutorial guiding you to create one type with one instance. Have a look at the **chatbot_setup_advanced.jpynp** for more advanced features.\n",

    "##### 1.1. Set the OpenAI API Key and Model\n",
